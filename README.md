# Welcome to the CEEDS use-python GitHub repo!

This repo stores or links to demos and tutorials from the CEEDS Coding Club Python sessions. Feel free to use and re-use - head to [demos](./demos) for all materials.

We meet every other Tuesday at 1pm to demo useful Python tricks, debug our coding problems, and just to chat.

We have a Slack channel where we communicate. Message Sam Harrison if you'd like an invite or to get the link to the Tuesday sessions.
